MyProxy Privacy Policy

Effective Date: February 10, 2025

Thank you for using MyProxy (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information.

### 1. No Data Collection
   MyProxy **DOES NOT**  collect, store, or transmit any personal data. We **DO NOT** collect any of the following:
- IP addresses (public or destination)

- Device identifiers or advertising IDs

- Traffic logs or browsing activity

- Connection duration or timestamps

- Location data or network type

- Crash reports or diagnostic data

- Personally identifiable information (PII) of any kind

### 2. No Built-in Analytics or Tracking
   The App does not include any analytics SDKs, ad tracking libraries, or background telemetry services. Your usage of the App remains entirely on your device.

### 3. Optional Server Configuration
   MyProxy allows you to configure your own VPN or proxy servers. While the App may include a sample or default server for demonstration purposes, these servers operate independently and are **not designed or intended** to collect any user data.

### 4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
   The App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children. Since the App requires no login or registration, we do not have any way of identifying the age of users.

### 5. Data Security
   All network traffic routed through MyProxy is encrypted using secure protocols. Since no data is collected, there is nothing stored or at risk of breach.

### 6. Changes to This Policy
   We may update this Privacy Policy if the nature of the App changes in the future. All updates will be posted at the same link.
