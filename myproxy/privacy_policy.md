# MyProxy Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2025-04-24 PDT

Thank you for using **MyProxy** (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information.

### 1. No Data Collection
MyProxy **DOES NOT collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII)**. We only retain **anonymized technical logs** for operational reliability. Specifically, we **DO NOT** collect:
-  IP addresses (public or destination)
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Browsing history or DNS queries
- User accounts or authentication tokens
- Personally identifiable information (PII)
### 2. Operational Logging (Anonymous & Disk-Based)

To ensure service reliability, MyProxy records minimal **anonymous connection logs** to disk. These logs are used **only for technical monitoring and troubleshooting** and include:
- Timestamps of connection events

- Data transfer sizes (e.g., bytes sent/received)

- Duration of each session

- Generalized geo-location (e.g., Fremont/California/US) via **non-reversible** IP lookup

- Anonymized session identifiers (e.g., src: 18a7711f, tar: 974412d7), which are generated by hashing and **cannot be linked to any individual**

> **We DO NOT store actual IP addresses**, and all logged information is **fully anonymized** and never associated with a user identity. Logs are rotated periodically and are **NOT shared with any third parties**.

### 2a. Anonymous App Events

To improve app compatibility and optimize service delivery, MyProxy may report **anonymous client events**, including:

- App startup (initial launch)
- VPN connection attempts

These reports contain **only non-personal** technical details such as:

- A random, non-resettable device ID (e.g., UUID)
- App version and source channel
- An approximate location (e.g., city, region, country) inferred from the device’s public IP address. This information is **coarse** and **CANNOT** be used to identify individual users.
- Timestamp of the event
- The selected server node identifier (e.g., "us1")

These reports **DO NOT CONTAIN** user IP addresses, DNS queries, browsing history, or any data that could directly identify you. All reports are **anonymized**, used solely for improving service quality, and are **not shared with third parties**.

### 3. No Built-in Analytics or Tracking
   The App **does not** include any analytics SDKs, ad tracking libraries, or background telemetry services. Your usage of the App remains entirely on your device.

### 4. Optional Server Configuration
   MyProxy allows you to configure your own VPN or proxy servers. While the App may include a sample or default server for demonstration purposes, these servers operate independently and are **not designed or intended** to collect any user data.

### 5. Children’s Privacy
   The App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children. Since the App requires no login or registration, we do not have any way of identifying the age of users.

### 6. Data Security
   All network traffic routed through MyProxy is encrypted using secure protocols. Since no data is collected, there is nothing stored or at risk of breach.

### 7. Changes to This Policy
   We may update this Privacy Policy if the nature of the App changes in the future. All updates will be posted at the same link.
